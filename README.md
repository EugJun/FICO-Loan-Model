## 📊 Loan Approval Trends Analysis Using FICO Data
  This project explores key trends and patterns in loan approvals using a 2023 FICO dataset. The primary goal was to analyze factors that influence loan approval decisions—such as debt-to-income ratio (DTI), loan amount, race, gender, and income. Although the original intent included building a basic prediction model using regression techniques, only the exploratory data analysis (EDA) portion was completed due to time constraints and data cleaning challenges.

### ✅ Project Summary
Data Source: FICO Score Data (2023)

Initial Dataset Size: 617,996 instances, 27 features

Cleaned Dataset Size: 315,416 instances, 14 features

Key Focus Areas:

-Gender and race impact on approval rates

-Influence of DTI and income

-Correlation between loan amount and loan approval

-Imputation and feature engineering techniques

### 🔍 Key Findings
-Most Approved Gender Pair: Female & Female (94.3% approval)

-Highest Approval by Race: White (92.5% approval)

-Ideal DTI Range for Approval: 60–80%

-Loan Range with Highest Approval: $400K–$500K

-Approval Rate Correlation:

-DTI vs Outcome: -0.0482

-Loan Amount vs Outcome: 0.0325

### 📉 Limitations
-The final model does not include a machine learning component.

-Missing values and inconsistencies required extensive cleaning and imputation.

-Regression modeling was not implemented due to time constraints.

### 📂 Contents
-A detailed PowerPoint presentation summarizing trends and findings.

-Cleaned dataset preparation logic (feature engineering, imputation).

-Visual insights derived from gender, DTI, race, and income data.

### 🛠 Future Improvements
-Implement a basic regression model to predict loan approval.

-Integrate a web tool for users to estimate approval likelihood.

-Expand analysis to include fairness metrics and bias detection.
